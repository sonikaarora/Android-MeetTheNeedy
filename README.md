# Android-MeetTheNeedy

The motivation for this project was to help the needy by providing the donors an easy and efficient solution to make donations efficiently and at the same time help the organizations to view all the donations. These are organizations which collect items for the needy and distribute the items to the needy either on a daily basis or are used in case of any natural calamity where the donation of any type makes a large difference. 

Currently, there are some applications which collect the donations, but such applications are owned by the organizations. Also, the majority of such applications only collect monetary donations. This application brings the organization and the donors on a single platform thus supporting many organizations and their respective donors. It also provides users a facility to donate a variety of items including books, clothes, money and food which will be collected by the organizations once the user makes donations.
